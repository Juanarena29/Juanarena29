## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a **Data & AI Engineer Jr** in training, currently pursuing my degree in **Computer Science (Lic. en Sistemas)** at **Universidad Nacional de La Plata (UNLP)**.

I work with **Python and SQL** to build **machine learning pipelines**, develop **predictive models**, and create **data-driven solutions**. I have hands-on experience with **end-to-end ML workflows**, designing **modular architectures**, implementing **automated testing**, and applying **software engineering best practices** to ensure scalable and maintainable code.

My goal is to join a team as a **Junior Data Engineer, ML Engineer, or Data Analyst**, where I can contribute with reliable data solutions, production-ready ML models, and continue growing professionally.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🎓 ML Workflow – Educational Machine Learning Tool  
**Technologies:** Python, Streamlit, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, Plotly, joblib  

Educational web application that **guides users step by step through the complete Machine Learning workflow**, from data ingestion to model prediction and evaluation.

- **Hybrid educational / tooling design**, featuring:
  - **Learn mode**: guided explanations of each ML stage
  - **Tool mode**: hands-on, practical usage for real datasets
- **Explicit project state management**, tracking:
  - original dataset
  - data cleaning steps
  - target selection
  - problem type
  - trained models
- **Built-in validations and guardrails** at each stage to prevent common ML mistakes  
  (invalid target selection, data leakage, inconsistent datasets, etc.).
- **Guided data cleaning configuration**, combining automatic suggestions with full user control.
- **Support for regression and classification problems**, including:
  - appropriate metrics
  - interpretable visualizations
  - error analysis
- **Prediction on new data**, with prediction vs. ground truth comparison when the target is available.
- **Modular and extensible architecture**, prioritizing clarity, reproducibility, and ML best practices over opaque automation.

### 🏨 Rental Management System – Tourist Complex  
**Technologies:** C#, ASP.NET Core 8, Blazor Server, EF Core 8, SQL Server (Azure), xUnit, Moq, FluentAssertions

Custom-built web application developed **to client specifications** for a real 7-apartment tourist complex in Las Grutas, Río Negro. Replaces manual booking logs, WhatsApp notes and spreadsheets with a fully centralized management system.

- **Clean Architecture** across 4 layers (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Web) with strict dependency rules — Domain has zero external dependencies
- **29 independent Use Cases**, each encapsulating a single business operation for maximum testability and maintainability
- **Overlap detection** — prevents double-booking with composite index-backed queries
- **ACID payment transactions** using Unit of Work pattern, with rollback verified by automated tests
- **Security-first authentication**: PBKDF2 SHA-256 (100k iterations), timing-safe password comparison, anti user-enumeration design
- **Occupancy statistics**: occupancy rate, daily revenue, check-in/check-out dashboard
- **Automated testing** with xUnit + Moq + FluentAssertions — 66 tests covering critical use cases including transaction rollback and security edge cases
- **Production database**: Azure SQL Server — switchable to SQLite locally via single config line
